## Usage
This module, when imported in Foundry VTT, the Gamemaster will have access to a compendium of the same name as the module.  This compendium has all the actors pre-made with optional NPC features and token images pre-configured.  Each combat folder has all variations of the actors for 3, 4, and 5 player character encounters as written.  These can be dragged into the Actors tab either as whole folders or individually as desired.

There are extra tokens available in "%LocalAppData%\FoundryVTT\Data\modules\in-golden-flame-act-1-actors\tokens" when this module is imported.  Feel free to browse the tokens provided by those listed in the token attributions below, and use any alternates you may prefer after you drag your actors to your Actors tab.  These could also be used if you make more actors to customize your encounters.

### The Community at Large

I decided to make this because of how grateful I am for all the other tools made and help provided by the Lancer community as a whole.  Hopefully this is useful to get people off the ground running with the base actors made for the pre-written encounters in In Golden Flam Act 1.
